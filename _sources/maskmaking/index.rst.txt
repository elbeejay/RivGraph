*RivGraph* requires that you provide a mask of your channel network. A mask is simply a binary image (only ones and zeros) where pixels belonging to the channel network are "on", like the right panel of the Lena Delta above. In this document, we'll cover the following:


 - :ref:`maskcapture`
 - :ref:`wheretoget`
 - :ref:`howtoprep`
 - :ref:`georef`
 - :ref:`nonriver`
 - :ref:`supportedfiletypes`

.. important::
  One thing to keep in mind: although *RivGraph* contains functions for pruning and otherwise modifying your channel network, it will always honor the mask you provide. You may need to iterate between altering your mask and *RivGraph*-ing it to achieve your desired results.
  "Garbage in, garbage out."


.. _maskcapture:

---------------------------
What should a mask capture?
---------------------------

Above, we defined a mask as all the pixels "belonging to the channel network." But which pixels are part of the channel network? The obvious starting point is to consider all *surface water* pixels as defining the channel network. Is it important that your mask shows bankfull channels or includes small streams that may only be active during flood conditions?

As an example, four masks are shown above of a portion of the Brahmaputra River at four different days of 2004. The hydrograph of the river is shown in the left panel. As expected, you can see that the mask changes as the river floods and recedes. You can also see that the river channel network has been rearranged in some places by the flooding. For example, **A** and **D** show the river at roughly the same discharge, but the network in **D** is a result of reworking by the flood.

The bottom line here is that your mask should reflect your analysis goals. For example, if you're only interested in counting the number of loops in a delta channel network, then you might only care about ensuring all the channels are represented. If you want to route fluxes through your extracted network, then you probably should try to obtain a mask that captures the full width of the channels at some representative discharge.

.. _wheretoget:

----------------------
Where do I get a mask?
----------------------
Masks can come from a variety of sources, but in my experience there are three primary methods for mask generation:

  - automatically generated from satellite imagery
  - manually drawn by hand
  - model/simulation outputs

There are *many* methods available for creating masks automatically from remotely-sensed imagery. We won't get into the details of those here, but note that machine learning has proved a very valuable tool for maskmaking. There are also simple, proven techniques available as well. The Brahmaputra masks above were created by thresholding the Landsat-derived NDVI (`Normalized Difference Vegetation Index <https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-normalized-difference-vegetation-index>`_
), which is a simple ratio of band values.

Drawing a mask by hand is often not an ideal choice, but might be the most efficient way to move forward. In these cases, I would typically use QGIS to draw polygons that cover the channel network, then use the `Rasterize  <https://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/gdalogr/gdal_conversion/rasterize.html>`_
tool to convert the polygons to a binary raster (image). If you go this route, be sure to specify an appropriate coordinate reference system for your polygons in order to preserve the georeferencing information (don't use EPSG:4326). You will also need to specify a pixel resolution for your mask upon conversion.

If you're analyzing the output of a simulation, it is unlikely that the simulation will provide binary channel masks as an output. In these cases, you will need to develop a way to identify the channel network from the available simulation results. For example, while developing the entropic Braided Index (`eBI <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFMEP51E2163T/abstract>`_
), we used Delft3D simulations to test hypotheses about how the eBI changes under various sedimentation schemes. To make masks, we developed a combined depth + discharge threshold to identify which pixels were part of the "active river channel." 

Here are some resources that either provide masks or tools for you to make your own.

- Published masks:

  - `Arctic deltas <https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1505624>`_, made with eCognition and Landsat imagery.
  - `Indus and Brahmaputra Rivers <https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/8/87/2020/#section6>`_, clipped from GRWL dataset. 
  - `Global mask <https://zenodo.org/record/1297434>`_ of Landsat-derived rivers at "mean annual discharge." Has some issues at tile boundaries, and can be "feathery" along braided rivers, but not a bad global mask.
  - `Global Surface Water Dataset <https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/>`_ - provides all water pixels in the Landsat archive as monthly global images and as integrated-through-time images. For example, can threshold on the "Occurrence" product to make a mask. Use `Google Earth Engine <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JRC_GSW1_2_GlobalSurfaceWater>`_ to access and create your masks.
  - If you know of more, please mention them in the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/jonschwenk/RivGraph/issues>`_!

- You can relatively quickly train and apply ML models using `Google Earth Engine <https://earthengine.google.com/>`_, although the learning curve may be a little steep if you haven't used it before.
  
- `DeepWaterMap  <https://github.com/isikdogan/deepwatermap>`_ is a trained deep convolutional neural network that you can apply to Landsat/Sentinel multispectral imagery to create your own masks. You can also improve DeepWaterMap's base model by adding more training data. Requires some knowledge of Tensorflow.




.. _howtoprep:

-----------------------------
How should I prepare my mask?
-----------------------------

The quality of your mask directly translates to the quality of your channel network. 

.. _georef:

--------------------------------------
Does my mask need to be georeferenced?
--------------------------------------

Most masks are already produced in a GIS context and are already geographically referenced. However,*RivGraph* does not require that your mask image be georeferenced (e.g. a GeoTIFF). If you provide a mask without any georeference information, *RivGraph* will assign it a "dummy" projection in order to proceed. This has no effect on the network extraction. However, it is strongly advised that you provide a georeferenced mask. There are three primary reasons for this:

1) The coordinate reference system (CRS) of your mask will be carried through all your analysis, meaning that shapefiles and GeoTIFFs you export using *RivGraph* will align perfectly with your mask. Additionally, your results will be easily importable into a GIS for further analysis or fusion with other geospatial data.

2) *RivGraph* computes morphologic metrics (length and width) using pixel coordinates. A georeferenced mask contains information about the units of the mask, and thus any metrics of physical distance will inherit these units. If your CRS is meters-based, your results will be in meters.

3) Some of *RivGraph*'s functionality under the hood requires some heuristic thresholds or parameters. While these were designed to be as CRS-agnostic as possible, these functions will undoubtedly perform better when pixels have known units. As an example, generating a mesh along a braided river corridor requires some parameters defining the size and smoothness of the mesh. Having a mask with physically-meaningful units makes this parameterization much simpler and more intuitive. 

.. warning::
  You should **avoid** degree-based CRSs (like EPSG:4326). This is because the length of a degree is not uniform, but varies with latitude. For example, at the equator, a degree of longitude is roughly 111 km. In Anchorage, Alaska, a degree of longitude is approximately 55 km. Effectively, degrees are meaningless units of physical measurements. A more prudent approach would be to first project your mask into a meters-based CRS (e.g. the appropriate `UTM zone <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system>`_) before analysis with *RivGraph*.

.. _nonriver:

---------------------------------------------------
Can my mask represent something that isn't a river?
---------------------------------------------------

Perhaps you'd like to vectorize a road network or a vascular system. This is possible to do with *RivGraph*. However, you will not be able to instantiate the convenient *delta* or *river* classes as they are designed only for river channel networks. Instead, you will need to poke around the API to figure out which functions will work for you. A good starting point is to skeletonize your mask with `skeletonize_mask <https://jonschwenk.github.io/RivGraph/apiref/rivgraph.html#rivgraph.mask_to_graph.skeletonize_mask>`_, then run `skel_to_graph  <jonschwenk.github.io/RivGraph/apiref/rivgraph.html#rivgraph.mask_to_graph.skel_to_graph>`_ to convert the skeleton to a set of links and nodes. If you have an interesting non-river use-case, please send an email to j........k@gmail.com and we can add it as an example.
